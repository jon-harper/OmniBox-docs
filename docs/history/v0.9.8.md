- Documentation greatly improved for newcomers.
- Fan cages provide much more airflow, print more quickly, and use less material.

## New Features

### Completed Requests

| Hardware | Mount Location(s) | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| Creality MOSFET | Lower bay | |
| DROK 5A buck converter | Lower bay | Full sized tray only. |
| 80mm fans | Rear panel, lid | Supports 20 & 25mm thicknesses. |

Other:

- New rear panel for the Ender 5 Plus with an 80mm fan.

### Experimental Hardware Support

| Hardware | Mount Location(s) | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| Mean Well RSP-500 power supply | Main body | For the Ender 5 Plus |
| Raspberry Pi TFTs | Display mount or half-lid | |
| Fotek SSR-60 DA solid state relay | Lower bay | |
| 92mm fans | Rear panel, lid | 25mm thickness; no compatible mount yet. |

### Core Improvements
- New front vents for the base and larger side vents.
- Two new optional 40mm fans concealed in the intakes.
- MCU trays can be removed without removing the rear panel.
- Fan cages have a parametric template.

### Panel and Tray Improvements
- New half-length lids.
- New half-length lower bay trays.
- Lower bay trays for buck converters and simple, 4-point mounts are now Fusion 360 templates.
- New trays can be added by modifying the Fusion template and exporting the results.
- The template includes mounts with fans and the new half-length size.

## Documentation & Repository Changes
- Broke out product support documentation across three pages. Each product includes images and mounting hardware.
- Divided assembly documentation into three sections and added info for Core variants.
- Improved/better overall folder structure; all panel and tray variations have a separate folder.
- Most git folders now have a `readme.md` to help with navigation and part selection.

## Known Issues

- The front main body with a 40mm intake fan partially obscures a mounting hole for the base to the main body. This leave seven (7) other mount points and is not a significant issue. The hole can safely be left empty.
