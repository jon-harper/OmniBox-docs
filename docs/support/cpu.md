Single board computers (SBC) like the Raspberry Pi are mounted on :material-alpha-t-box: :material-alpha-c-box-outline: CPU Trays. These parts are in the [`Trays/CPU`][git_cpu] git folder; each component has its own subfolder. Currently, SBCs other than the Raspberry Pi are not supported.

If you do not use an SBC, the side of the bay can be used as a [:material-alpha-p-box: :material-alpha-s-box-outline: Side Panel][panel_mounts].
