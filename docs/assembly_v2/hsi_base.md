## Directions

  <figcaption>1. Set the base in front of you standing upright as pictured.</figcaption>

  <figcaption>2. Put a heat set insert into each of the two (2) 4.5mm holes.</figcaption>
</figure>

!!! note
    Insert *may* require light force and "pop" in place, particularly on holes printed along the Z axis.

  <figcaption>3. Using a soldering iron at a low heat (~200C), place the tip on the insert. As the insert heats and begins softening the plastic around it, lightly push down into the hole until the insert is flush or slightly below the surface.</figcaption>
</figure>

!!! note
    The insert holes have a slight inward slope. Resistance will gradually increase as the insert slides in place. Resistance greatly increases when the insert deviates from the hole.

    If the insert enters at an angle, reheating the insert with the soldering iron and tilting it upright will fix the issue. The plastic around the insert will melt around the insert as it is tilted upright.
