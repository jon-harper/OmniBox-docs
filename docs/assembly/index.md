## Overview

This guide is divided into three sections:

- [:material-alpha-c-box: Core][2]: Assembly of the main body and base; power supply mounting
- [:material-alpha-t-box: Trays][3]: Lower bay, CPU, and MCU tray assembly
- [:material-alpha-p-box: Panels][4]: Displays, lids, front & rear panels

Photos from these instructions are for the 0.9.8 release. If you have an older or newer version, some details may differ.

!!! note
    The example photos in some steps use slightly different versions of OmniBox. The differences in appearance will not affect the assembly process.

## Time

Assembly takes approximately one to two hours.

This estimate assumes that you:

- Have printed all [necessary parts][1], and
- Have never assembled an OmniBox.

Estimated time does not include the time needed to run and attach wiring.

## Configurations

These instructions are for the default OmniBox fan configuration with two 40mm fans for the rear main body and no front body fan. The instructions cover aspects of mounting fan cages common for all OmniBox fan mounts. The size, location, and number of fans in your configuration may vary.

This guide cannot cover every mounting combination for trays and panels; however, the git repository should have Bill of Material information for mounting components to their respective tray or panel.

Areas where the :material-alpha-c-box: Core parts may differ from instructions are specifically called out.
