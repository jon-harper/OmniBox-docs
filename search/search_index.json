A complete OmniBox made of parts from one release is tested to fit and work. Trays and panels are compatible with all releases (see Version Stability Guarantee for details). The Version History page contains information on the latest release, fixes, new features, and known issues. Version Stability Guarantee Printing OmniBox is an investment. As such, the way trays and panels attach to OmniBox between versions is carefully fixed. As such, OmniBox is highly modular and can be upgraded piece by piece. Note Prior versions of this page had the Version Stability Guarantee fully in place. I have relaxed it until version 1.0 in order to deprecate M4-mounted parts. No reprinting is necessary to use old M4 panels with M3 screws, however. Currently (Before Version 1.0) Prior to version 1.0, changes may still be made to how panels and trays interface with the Core case. Deprecated parts remain available and supported through the release of 1.0 and every effort is made to avoid incompatibilities between versions. Thus far, all deprecated printed parts remain compatible with new cases. Version 1.0 With version 1.0, changes may be made that cause deprecated parts to lose compatibility. This is a final chance to \"lock in\" the design. After Version 1.0 Starting with version 1.0, OmniBox will have a \"Version Stability Guarantee\": The Core printed components of OmniBox will be \"stable\" or \"frozen\" in how they connect with with other parts. If you choose to print a newer version of a Core part, no panels or trays will need to be reprinted. New products added in future releases can likewise be used in the Core case body from a prior release. Example As an example, the design for CPU trays was modified for 0.9.9. A CPU tray from 0.9.8 will: Work with a case from 0.9.9 and May not work with version 1.0. A version 0.9.9 case: Can use CPU trays from any release.

I printed my first of Steve Burcham's cases to remove my electronics from such heat (OmniBox is derived from his work). Managing Devices Common devices like fans and lights (and Raspberry Pis!) need a buck converter lower the voltage from a 3D printer's power supply. My printed cases for these printer/enclosure combos became cramped with them. Each buck converter had to sit on a tray above the microcontroller unit (MCU); wiring changes to the MCU required that I first remove up to three buck converter trays.

Overview A finished OmniBox. The configuration in the image above will be our example in this guide. We will start with the Core components and move on to the trays and panels that make OmniBox so modular. Core Components Core components form the basis of every case. Core files be found in the Core folder in the GitHub repository. Important Most Core components come with the option of using heat set inserts. These STL files have HSI in the name. The core components of an OmniBox with fans and power supply mounted. There are two types of Core components, Base and Main Body. A typical OmniBox build has three parts for the main body and two for the base. Base Front Rear Unified (replaces the above two) Main Body Crossbar Front Rear Base Base - Front This is the front of two base pieces that cover the power supply. There is a 30mm x 11mm rocker switch cutout in front, as well as air vents and optional 40mm fan mounts. GitHub Folder Base - Rear The back covers the rest of the power supply and mounts a fused IEC power plug. GitHub Folder This component is available with heat set inserts. Base - Unified For owners of large-format printers, the base can be printed as a single piece instead of two. The unified base replaces the rear and front pieces. GitHub Folder This component is available with heat set inserts. Main Body Main Body - Crossbar This is a crossbar that joins and covers the joint between the lids and front display. GitHub Folder There are no variations to the crossbar. Main Body - Front The front main body comes in two variations to choose from: Internal 40mm Fan External 60mm Fan The version with a 60mm external fan additional requires the appropriate fan cage . Optionally, a TPU gasket can also be used with the fan cage. GitHub Folder This component is available with heat set inserts. Main Body - Rear The rear main body comes in two variations: Dual 40mm Fans No Fan Mounts For the dual 40mm fan version, you will also need to print 40mm fan cages and (optionally) TPU gaskets. GitHub Folder This component is available with heat set inserts. Trays Trays are used for mounting parts internally. There are four (4) types of trays: The four types of trays in red. Power supply tray (PSU tray) MCU tray Lower bay tray CPU tray Tray templates are available in both STEP and Fusion 360 format to add support for new products. PSU Tray Power supply (PSU) trays slide up from underneath the case. Currently two power supplies are supported; a template is availabe to add support for more. Large (tall) power supplies require the use of a base extension shim . GitHub Folder Supported power supplies: Mean Well LRS-350 series Mean Well RSP-500 series (prelimary, requires base extensions) MCU Tray MCU trays mount a microcontroller unit--your 3D printer board. GitHub Folder List of supported MCUs Lower Bay Trays The lower bay is an area to mount parts like buck converters and MOSFETs. There are four dedicated lower bay trays locations and two more that can occupy an unused CPU tray bay. There are of these trays: Short and Long. A Long length tray covers the mount points of two Short trays and must be mounted from front to back of the case. GitHub Folder List of supported lower bay parts CPU Tray The CPU tray is an optional mount for a Raspberry Pi or other SoC. There are two bays for CPU trays; one is on each side of the case. An unused bay is replaced by a Side Panel . A short lower bay tray can also be installed in an unused CPU bay. GitHub Folder List of supported CPUs Panels The six types of panels. Front panel Display panel Lid Rear panel Side panel Bottom panel Panels cover the outside of OmniBox and mount of a range of options. Front, side, and rear panels are typically used for connectors, fans, and ventilation. There is a blank STEP and Fusion 360 template for each panel category to allow users to create new panels. Front Panel The front panel serves as an air vent and location to put a MicroSD card reader extension. USB extensions are also a common accessory.

This page covers: An overview of what to expect; Accounting for differences in configuration from this guide; and Best practices during assembly. Version Note Instructions in this Guide are for Release 0.9.9 . Details may differ for older or newer versions of OmniBox. Table of Contents The OmniBox Assembly Guide is divided into four main sections: 1. Heat Set Inserts (HSI) This section introduces HSIs, using them, and installing them in the case. Skip this section if you did not print an HSI case. Experienced users following this guide should be able to install all inserts in less than 30 minutes. Gaining experience with inserts saves time and lowers the chances of printed part damage. If you are using inserts for the first time, it is recommended that you print at least one practice block to gain a level of comfort. 2. Core & PSU Assembly starts in earnest by building the Base around the PSU and wiring it up. This acts as a first layer of the case that we will build upwards from. The section finishes by installing the Main Body. 3. CPU & Lower Bay Trays The second layer of the case adds the SoC CPU and lower bay components. By the end of this section, the \"floor\" of the case and front panel will be installed. 4. MCU & Panels At this point, assembly centers around the MCU, wiring, and closing up the case. Format Each section of the assembly has four parts: A short (3-15 second) optional video; A list of materials used and quantity; Step-by-step illustrated instructions; and A final reference image. All graphics can be enlarged to see detail by clicking or tapping. Time Most of the case can be assembled in approximately two (2) hours. This estimate assumes that you: Have printed all necessary parts ; and Have never assembled an OmniBox. This estimate does not include: Heat set insert (HSI) installation, if applicable; Time needed for wiring; and Power up/initial tests. Configurations These instructions are cover a generic OmniBox configuration. For example, the size, location, and number of fans in your configuration may vary, but the methods of mounting both internal and external fans are covered. This guide cannot cover every mounting combination for trays and panels; however, the git repository has Bill of Material information for mounting components to their respective tray or panel. Areas where the Core variants may differ from instructions are specifically called out. Techniques Assembly relies on a few general techniques reused throughout this guide. Fastening Screws Screws thread directly into the walls of the plastic where heat set inserts are not used. For example, lower bay trays attach to the main body with M3 screws. The trays have holes larger than the diameter of the screw, but the holes in the standoff are smaller. The screw \"bites\" the plastic of the standoff and the screw head to clamps down on the tray. Note Parts of the case that are frequently removed have deeper-than-necessary screw holes. You can use replace your screws with longer ones to get \"fresh\" plastic for the threads as the walls wear down. For example, over time you may need to switch from 8mm to 10mm screws. This is most common with the lid, as it is removed most often. Example Illustrations Illustrations for assembly are provided from isometric (angled and over-or-under) perspectives. The relevant parts for the current step are highlighted in each illustration. Mounting Fans The procedure for both internal and external fan mounting is covered in the guide. External fan cages and gaskets come in a number of sizes, but all sizes attach externally with the same type of cage. Note that fans 60mm and smaller use M3 screws; larger fans require M4 screws.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"assembly_v2/#overview","text":"Welcome to the Assembly Guide for OmniBox.

The Fans/Template folder contains parametric Fusion 360 files to add support for additional fans. 40x40x10mm Axial Fan GitHub Folder Product Link Mounting: 4x M3 x 16mm 40x40x20mm Axial Fan GitHub Folder Product Link Mounting: 4x M3 x 30mm 60x60x15mm Axial Fan GitHub Folder Product Link Mounting: 4x M3 x 25mm 60x60x20mm Axial Fan GitHub Folder Product Link Mounting: 4x M3 x 30mm 60x60x25mm Axial Fan GitHub Folder Product Link Mounting: 4x M3 x 35mm 80x80x20mm Axial Fan GitHub Folder Product Link Mounting: 4x M4 x 30mm 80x80x25mm Axial Fan GitHub Folder Product Link Mounting: 4x M4 x 35mm 92x92x25mm Axial Fan GitHub Folder Product Link Mounting: 4x M4 x 35mm 120x120x25mm Axial Fan GitHub Folder Product Link Mounting: 4x M4 x 35mm","title":"Fans"},{"location":"support/fans/#40x40x10mm-axial-fan","text":"GitHub Folder Product Link Mounting: 4x M3 x 16mm","title":"40x40x10mm Axial Fan"},{"location":"support/fans/#40x40x20mm-axial-fan","text":"GitHub Folder Product Link Mounting: 4x M3 x 30mm","title":"40x40x20mm Axial Fan"},{"location":"support/fans/#60x60x15mm-axial-fan","text":"GitHub Folder Product Link Mounting: 4x M3 x 25mm","title":"60x60x15mm Axial Fan"},{"location":"support/fans/#60x60x20mm-axial-fan","text":"GitHub Folder Product Link Mounting: 4x M3 x 30mm","title":"60x60x20mm Axial Fan"},{"location":"support/fans/#60x60x25mm-axial-fan","text":"GitHub Folder Product Link Mounting: 4x M3 x 35mm","title":"60x60x25mm Axial Fan"},{"location":"support/fans/#80x80x20mm-axial-fan","text":"GitHub Folder Product Link Mounting: 4x M4 x 30mm","title":"80x80x20mm Axial Fan"},{"location":"support/fans/#80x80x25mm-axial-fan","text":"GitHub Folder Product Link Mounting: 4x M4 x 35mm","title":"80x80x25mm Axial Fan"},{"location":"support/fans/#92x92x25mm-axial-fan","text":"GitHub Folder Product Link Mounting: 4x M4 x 35mm","title":"92x92x25mm Axial Fan"},{"location":"support/fans/#120x120x25mm-axial-fan","text":"GitHub Folder Product Link Mounting: 4x M4 x 35mm","title":"120x120x25mm Axial Fan"},{"location":"support/lower_bay/","text":"Lower Bay Trays mount below the MCU board and are used for a wide range of parts. Parts compatible with the lower bay are listed here. The Trays/Lower Bay git folder is organized with subfolders for each supported part. All variations based around that part are in the same folder. There are two types of Lower Bay Trays: Short and Long. A Long length tray covers the mount points of two Short trays and must be mounted from front to back of the case. Long trays fit as pictured on the left side or right. Short trays will also fit in an empty CPU bay. Buck Converters Long trays for buck converters often have a 40mm fan mount.
